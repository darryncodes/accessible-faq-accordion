### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Useful resources

-   [Use this instead of :focus in your css](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FHgnhnUwwQM) - This helps to have your focus styles when navigating by keyboard but not when clicking with a mouse.
-   [Creating Accessible Accordions with HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://dev.to/lizlaffitte/creating-an-accordion-with-html-css-javascript-3gmn) - Showing and hiding content is a common design pattern, using the right html attributes to help describe what's going on to screen readers is essential for inclusive user interfaces. I learnt about: `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-controls`.
