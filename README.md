## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
-   Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JavaScript

### Useful resources

-   [Use this instead of :focus in your css](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FHgnhnUwwQM) - This helps to have your focus styles when navigating by keyboard but not when clicking with a mouse.
-   [Creating Accessible Accordions with HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://dev.to/lizlaffitte/creating-an-accordion-with-html-css-javascript-3gmn) - Showing and hiding content is a common design pattern, using the right html attributes to help describe what's going on to screen readers is essential for inclusive user interfaces. I learnt about: `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-controls`.
